PiGFX RTG Installer
===================

Unfortunately, there are some Picasso96 settings files required to use 
PiGFX RTG on PiStorm that are not able to be freely distributed.

This installer will patch and copy some files from the original install 
folder to create the required monitor file and settings files. This will 
save you having to create these and setting up all the resolutions 
manually.

The card files currently in the installer are from the WIP-crap branch
as of 24th August 2021.

Requirements
============

This installer requires you to already have installed Picasso96 on 
your PiStorm machine. 

During the Picasso96 installation you can choose any graphics board 
(or select none at all) as this will be ignored and new files for PiGFX
will be created.

The installer will also require access to the original installation 
files that are located in the folder from where you installed Picasso96. 

At the time of writing, the below versions of Picasso96 are have been 
tested, but other versions may work. 

Picasso96 v2.0 - This can be downloaded freely from Aminet here - 
                 https://aminet.net/package/driver/video/Picasso96

Picasso96 v3.02 - This can be purchased from Individual Computers for 
                  a small fee, and at the time of writing the latest 
                  version is v3.02. 


If you have any issues during the installation, please try using one of 
these versions, and do not modify the folder in any way. The installer 
requires the files to be in their original 
locations.

Any future versions of Picasso96 may require a new patch file to be 
created. If/whenIComp do release any future updates, the patch files 
will be updated accordingly if required.

Installation
============

Simply run the installer and it will walk you through the process.

Any old versions of the PiGFX files will be removed during the install
and new ones created by patching some of the original install files.

During the install, you will be asked to locate the original 
installation folder from where you installed Picasso96, this folder is 
typically called Picasso96Install.
